## My CC:Tweaked Programs hosted here!! 
Here are some of the programs I've written using for the minecraft mod CC:Tweaked.  
TO BE CLEAR, these programs outline behaviors that are carried out by shell computers (and robotic 'turtles') that are added by the minecraft mod CC: Tweaked, a new version of the classic mod ComputerCraft.  
These programs are written in Lua and I use Visual Studio: Code to write them, it helps with formatting and is just easier to use than the dos prompt-esque interface that is built into the CC: Tweaked computers. 
If I make videos or screenshots showcasing my programs, they will also be listed in this repo.
